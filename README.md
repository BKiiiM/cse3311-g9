Group 9's Project: AI generated recipes.

An intuitive mobile application that helps the user find cooking recipes that will empower them to cook new and varied meals everyday. The app will allow the user to enter the name of a dish or a set of ingredients and the app will suggest recipes based on those search values, along with custom filters based on the user’s dietary restrictions. As the project develops we want to add more features such as filtering out recipes according to calorie count or gluten content and creating a list that displays the macronutrients contained within each recipe. 


Features:
  User Account Creation:
    –Allow users to create an account using their email addresses.
    –Enable users to reset their password in case they forgot it.
  Dietary Preferences and Configurations:
    –During account creation, prompt users to specify their dietary restrictions and preferences (e.g., gluten-free, vegetarian/vegan, keto, allergies, dislikes).
    –Allow users to modify these preferences in their profile settings at any time.
  Home Screen/Landing Page:
    –Design an intuitive and visually appealing home screen with easy-to-navigate icons or tiles.
    –Include sections for ‘Recipe Search/Filter’, ‘Cooking Videos’, ‘Trending Recipes’, and ‘Daily Cooking Tip’
    –Implement a ‘Daily Cooking Tip’ feature that automatically updates with a new tip each day to keep users engaged and informed.
  Allergen Alerts:
    –Notify users when a recipe contains ingredients to which they have indicated as allergens.
  Nutritional Information:
    –Every generated recipe should include nutritional information, including calories, protein, total fat, saturated fat, total carbohydrates, sugars and sodium.
  Cooking Anti-Lock:
    –While a recipe is open, the application will prevent the device from locking/sleeping to ensure an uninterrupted cooking experience.
